# InCTRL

Official PyTorch implementation of "Toward Generalist Anomaly Detection via In-context Residual Learning with Few-shot Sample Prompts".(accepted by CVPR 2024)

The code will be released soon.

## Setup

## Run
#### Step 1. Download the Anomaly Detection Datasets

Download the Anomaly Detection Dataset and convert it to MVTec AD format. (For datasets we used in the paper, we provided the convert script.) 
The dataset folder structure should look like:
```
DATA_PATH/
    subset_1/
        train/
            good/
        test/
            good/
            defect_class_1/
            defect_class_2/
            defect_class_3/
            ...
    ...
```
#### Step 2. Save Training and Test Json Files

#### Step 3. Download the Few-shot Normal Samples for Inference on [Google Drive]

#### Step 4. Download the Pre-train Models on [Google Drive]

#### Step 5. Quick Start
